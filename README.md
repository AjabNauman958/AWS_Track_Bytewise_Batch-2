# AWS_Track_Bytewise_Batch-2
I learned about important services provided by AWS, such as IAM, EC2, VPC, S3, Lambda, and Route 53. These services are essential for cloud computing. I got this information from Stephane's training, which was very helpful. After the training, I used my knowledge to put my resume on an S3 bucket.
**IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is the first thing I learned. It helps control who can access and do things on AWS, making it easier to keep things secure. Then I learned about **EC2**, which is a platform for virtual servers. I used it to deploy programs and host websites. Next, I learned about **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**, which lets you create private networks. I learned how to set up secure networks, control how data is routed, and manage access to resources. I also learned about **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**, which is used for storing files in the cloud. I learned how to create storage buckets, upload and download files, and control who can access them. Another service I learned about is **Lambda**, which allows running code without managing servers. I learned how to create functions that can be triggered by events, like when a file is uploaded to S3. Additionally, I learned about **Route 53**, a service for managing domain names and directing website traffic. I learned how to register domain names, set up DNS, and ensure websites are accessible.
Finally, I applied what I learned by deploying my resume on an S3 bucket. I created a simple website and hosted it on AWS to showcase my skills. Overall, I gained knowledge about controlling user access, setting up virtual servers, securing networks, storing files in the cloud, running code without servers, managing domain names, and deploying websites. Deploying my resume was a great way to demonstrate what I learned and showcase my abilities.
